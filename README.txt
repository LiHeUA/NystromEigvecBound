This set of m-files demonstrates the main results in [1].  

"demo_Theorem1.m" verifies Theorem 1 in [1], or the expected error of matrix multiplication approximation.

"demo_Theorem2.m" verifies Theorem 2 in [1], or the Normalized Cuts Nystrom approximated eigenvector bound.

"demo_TrainingSizeSelection.m" verifies the training size selection algorithm, or Eq. (15), in [1].

To run those demos, simply start Matlab and run each demo file.
